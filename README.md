## LLaMA Text-to-Speech 

This is a basic TTS system that I created to experiment with giving chatbots a voice. I used the voice of Rose, a singer. It sounds good, but I found out that if we use the voice from the training dataset that they used to train the model, it works so much better. 

The entire pipeline is in `final_tts_testing.ipynb`. I'm afraid that I cannot give a clear demo on the working of the system because it is audio based and it depends on what the chatbot generates. I didn't save any responses.
